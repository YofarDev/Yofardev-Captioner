Ghibli style image of a character, likely male, lounging in a beach chair on a sandy shore. The character, wearing tan pants, a tan jacket with white gloves, and brown boots, is relaxing with a magazine covering their face. A dark umbrella stands beside the chair, providing shade. To the left of the chair is a small wooden table holding a retro radio, a partially eaten apple, a green bottle, and a glass with red liquid. A grey bucket sits on the ground next to the table. In the foreground there is a blue-and-white striped blanket, a wired telephone next to the chair. In the background, the sandy beach leads to clear blue water, and then a rocky cliff face. The scene is bathed in soft, natural lighting, characteristic of Ghibli animation.
